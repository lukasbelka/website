				Hi, I'm Lukas and I work in the (re)insurance industry since more than a decade.
				Until recently it was my job to make data human-friendly and readable, with a focus on
				data analytics and business kpis (application programming). I mainly coded in Python and R (Shiny).
				In 2020 I started to intensify working with data and got more and more into programming.
				Since 2023 I am a certified Data Analyst Professional and I hold the Data Modeling Certification
				of the DMI (Data Modeling Institute).
			</p>
			<p>
				Data was not always my focus. For more than ten years I have managed projects in the primary and
				reinsurance industry and most recently from 2018 to 2020 I managed the PMO of a large
				IT-transformation project in order to restructure the whole organizytion from a classical
				PM-approach into an agile way of working according to the SAFe framework.
			</p>
			<p>
				During this time, I realised that I wanted to become more professional in handling data to
				make and enable decision making based on hard facts. Furhter, instead of linking numerous Excel files
				via references, drawing gannt charts with Think Cell and reporting figures using .ppt slides,
				I wanted to automate as much as possible - this is why I learnt Python and became good in SQL.
