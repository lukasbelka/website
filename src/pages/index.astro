				Hi, I'm Lukas a (re)insurance professional who works in the industry since 2009. During that time
				I have managed projects and (from 2018 until 2020 I) headed the PMO of a large IT-transformation
				project in order to restructure the whole organization from a classical PM-approach into an agile
				way of working according to the SAFe framework.
			</p>
			<p>
				During this time, I realised that I wanted to become more professional in handling data in order to gain
				insights faster and make decisions based on hard facts. Furhter, instead of linking numerous Excel files
				via references, drawing gannt charts with Think Cell and reporting figures using .ppt slides,
				I wanted to automate as much as possible - this is why I learnt Python and became good in SQL.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until recently it was my job to make data human-friendly and readable, with a focus on
				data analytics and business kpis (application programming). I mainly coded in Python and R (Shiny) and
				since 2023 I am a certified Data Analyst Professional and I hold the Data Modeling Certification
				of the DMI (Data Modeling Institute).
			</p>
			<p>
				Today I use that knowledge to be as productive as possible and enhance my processes @ work.
